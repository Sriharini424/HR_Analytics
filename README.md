# 1. Total Employees and Attrition Rate:

-> The company has 1,470 employees.

-> The attrition count is 237, leading to an attrition rate of 36.92%, which is relatively high.

# 2.Active Employees by Age Band and Gender:

-> The majority of employees fall within the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups.

-> More males are employed across all age groups compared to females.

-> Very few employees are under 25 or over 55.

# 3.Attrition by Department:

-> R&D department has the highest number of active employees but also experiences significant attrition.

-> Sales department has fewer employees but shows a notable attrition count.

-> HR department has the least number of employees and a relatively low attrition count.

# 4.Education Field and Attrition:

-> The largest proportion of employees comes from the Life Sciences field (41.93%), followed by Technical Degrees (32.52%).

-> Other fields, such as Medical and Marketing, have relatively fewer employees.

-> A significant number of employees with Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s Degrees are leaving the company.

# 5.Marital Status and Gender Distribution:

-> Employees are categorized based on Marital Status (Single, Married, Divorced) and Gender (Male, Female).

-> Gender-based insights can help identify trends in attrition or job satisfaction levels.

# 6.Monthly Income by Job Role:

-> Employees in Research and Managerial roles tend to earn the highest salaries.

-> Employees in Sales, Labor, and Support roles earn lower salaries.

-> Income disparities across job roles could influence attrition.

# 7.Education and Attrition Count:

-> Employees with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree and Masterâ€™s Degree contribute the most to attrition.

-> Those with a Doctoral Degree have the least attrition, possibly indicating stronger job retention.

# 1.Total Active Employees & Average Age:

-> The organization has 1,233 active employees.

-> The average age of employees is 37, suggesting a workforce primarily composed of mid-career professionals.

# 2.Job Role Distribution:

-> The largest job roles by employee count are:

Sales Executives (269)

Research Scientists (245)

Manufacturing Directors (135)

-> The smallest job roles include:

Human Resources (40)

Research Directors (78)

Managers (97)

# 3.Education Levels Among Employees:

-> Most employees hold a Bachelorâ€™s Degree, followed by Masterâ€™s Degrees.

-> A relatively smaller percentage have Associate Degrees.

-> No employees are listed with only a High School diploma, indicating a highly educated workforce.

# 4.Attrition Rate by Gender & Age Group:

-> Younger employees (under 25 & 25-34) have the highest attrition rates.

-> Attrition decreases as employees age, with those over 55 having the lowest attrition.

# 5.Gender disparity in attrition:

-> Males have higher attrition in some age groups (e.g., 61.61% of 25-34 attrition is male).

-> In older age groups, the trend balances out.
